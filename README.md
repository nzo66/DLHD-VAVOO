# Usage Instructions

To use these playlists/lists, you must route your requests through the following proxy:

[mediaflow-proxy](https://github.com/nzo66/mediaflow-proxy) or [EasyProxy](https://github.com/nzo66/easyproxy)

This proxy is required to ensure proper access and functionality.

## Steps
1. Set up and run the [mediaflow-proxy](https://github.com/nzo66/mediaflow-proxy) or [EasyProxy](https://github.com/nzo66/easyproxy) by following the instructions in its repository.
2. Configure your player or application to use the proxy for all requests to these lists.

**Note:** Direct access to these lists without the proxy may not work as intended.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you want to merge both the **DLHD** and **VAVOO** playlists into a single combined list, you can do it easily through **mediaflow-proxy** â€” it supports merging multiple lists into one unified output.
